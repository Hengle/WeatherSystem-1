### What is this repository for? ###

An open source and free-to-use weather system package for Unity produced as an undergraduate dissertation piece. 

**Version:** [v1.0](https://github.com/Slord6/WeatherSystem/releases/tag/1.0)

**Features:**
* Provides procedural and manually curated weather events. In procedural mode the weather is changable across the game world at any given instance.
* Provides a queryable interface for further customisation based on weather intensity, temperature and humidity for any given location in the game world. Also includes various delegate callbacks on key events; `OnWeatherChangeBeginEvent`, `OnWeatherChangeStep` and `OnWeatherChangeCompleteEvent`.
* Follows OOP principles to allow for custom extensions and modification and deals with weather in a generic way to allow for any weather type to be added.
* Includes example code and documentation.
* Is fully open source under the MIT licence (see below).

### What's here? ###

* Unity 2017.3 Project (Although use with other versions has been successful so worth testing irrelevant of Unity version)
